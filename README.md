## Otago Marketplace

![CI](https://github.com/vicmon810/Otago__Market__place/actions)

### Project Description
As staff members, we often find ourselves in need of new items for our offices or shared areas
within our department, such as furniture, a spare microwave, or a coffee machine. Unfortunately,
we typically rely on emails or conversations with colleagues to discover the availability of these
items. It would be more efficient if we had a web application similar to TradeMe, where both staff
and administrative personnel could list items they need or want to give away. This would help us to
more easily connect with each other and ensure that available resources are being utilized
effectively. Could you develop such a app for our department?
